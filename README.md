# lets_chat
Consisting of 20+ classes,and over 1500 lines of code I have Built "LetsChat" App using FLutter SDK , Dart Programming language and Google's firebase as backend.<br />
The Features Are Listed Below :<br />
 -> Authentication is required to use the app using Signin and Signup options.<br />
 -> User Online/Offline Status.<br />
 -> User's Typing status.<br />
 -> If user is online then a green light appears on the right side of the user name.<br />
 -> There's a search icon which allows user to search other users who are using the app and can start their conversation.<br />
 -> Welcome Screen appears with an Animation Of " Let's Chat " each time the app is opened.<br />
 -> Unique username for every user. <br />
<br />
And a lot of more functionalities that i am trying to add in near future.<br />
